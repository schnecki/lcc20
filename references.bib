@Article{Mahadevan96_AverageRewardReinforcementLearningFoundationsAlgorithmsAndEmpiricalResults,
  abstract =     {This paper presents a detailed study of average reward reinforcement learning, an
                  undiscounted optimality framework that is more appropriate for cyclical tasks than
                  the much better studied discounted framework. A wide spectrum of average reward
                  algorithms are described, ranging from synchronous dynamic programming methods to
                  several (provably convergent) asynchronous algorithms from optimal control and
                  learning automata. A general sensitive discount optimality metric called
                  n-discount-optimality is introduced, and used to compare the various algorithms.
                  The overview identifies a key similarity across several asynchronous algorithms
                  that is crucial to their convergence, namely independent estimation of the average
                  reward and the relative values. The overview also uncovers a surprising limitation
                  shared by the different algorithms: while several algorithms can provably generate
                  gain-optimal policies that maximize average reward, none of them can reliably
                  filter these to produce bias-optimal (or T-optimal) policies that also maximize
                  the finite reward to absorbing goal states. This paper also presents a detailed
                  empirical study of R-learning, an average reward reinforcement learning method,
                  using two empirical testbeds: a stochastic grid world domain and a simulated robot
                  environment A detailed sensitivity analysis of R-learning is carried out to test
                  its dependence on learning rates and exploration levels. The results suggest that
                  R-learning is quite sensitive to exploration strategies, and can fall into
                  sub-optimal limit cycles. The performance of R-learning is also compared with that
                  of Q-learning, the best studied discounted RL method. Here, the results suggest
                  that R-learning can be fine-tuned to give better performance than Q-learning in
                  both domains.},
