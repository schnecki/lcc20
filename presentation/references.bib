  abstract =     {This study was conducted in an auto spare parts production plant where the biggest
                  bottleneck in managing the enterprise is the lack of fulfilling the requisitions
                  of the customers on time. The main reason for the delay is the absence of
                  operation time data valid for the required parts ordered with different
                  specifications. For preparing effective schedules and for eliminating the
                  bottleneck, the factory needs to use reliable operation time data for each part
                  produced. An artificial neural network (ANN) approach was used for this purpose,
                  and its forecasting performance was compared with that of multiple linear and
                  nonlinear regression models. Based on the statistical analyses, the ANN approach
                  outperformed the regression models and is found to be more reliable in forecasting
                  the operation times. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract =     {Workload control concepts are advocated as one of the new production planning and
                  control methods. In its elaborated form, workload control includes three major
                  decision levels: job entry, job release and priority dispatching. In each decision
                  level, several decision points which have significant impact on the effectiveness
                  of the production planning and control are defined (i.e., acceptance/rejection,
                  due date assignment, etc.). Workload control systems should consider all of these
                  decision points simultaneously in order to improve the effectiveness of production
                  planning and control. In addition to these decision levels, flexibility of the
                  shop can also be included as the fourth decision level which allows the shop
                  capacity to be adjusted as new orders enter the system and as they are released to
                  the shop floor. In this study, simulation models which enable the effect of each
                  decision level within a workload control concept to be explored are developed and
                  tested. The results reveal that simultaneous consideration of decision levels is
                  critical and can improve the effectiveness of production planning and control.},

  abstract =     {Cycle time reduction plays an important role in improving the competitiveness and
                  sustainability of a semiconductor manufacturer. However, in the past, cycle time
                  reduction was usually unplanned owing to the lack of a systematic and quantitative
                  procedure. To tackle this problem, a systematic procedure was established in this
                  study for planning cycle time reduction actions to enhance the competitiveness and
                  sustainability of a semiconductor manufacturer. First, some controllable factors
                  that are influential to the job cycle time are identified. Subsequently, the
                  relationship between the controllable factors and the job cycle time is fitted
                  with a back propagation network. Based on this relationship, actions to shorten
                  the job cycle time can be planned. The feasibility and effectiveness of an action
                  have to be assessed before it can be taken in practice. An example containing the
                  real data of hundreds of jobs has been used to illustrate the applicability of the
                  proposed methodology. In addition, the financial benefits of the cycle time
                  reduction action were analyzed, which provided the evidence that the proposed
                  methodology enabled the sustainable development of the semiconductor manufacturer,
                  since capital adequacy is very important in the semiconductor manufacturing

                  production. The release methods of the traditional workload control concepts
                  differ in how they deal with the flow of work to each station. Previous research
                  has pointed at strengths and weaknesses of each method. Till now the choice of the
                  appropriate method for a particular situation has hardly received attention. This
                  research shows that shop characteristics are an important factor to this choice. A
                  simulation study indicates that the relative performance of the release methods
                  changes completely with for instance the presence or absence of a dominant flow
                  direction in the shop. Adjustments to the traditional release methods are
                  suggested which prove to make these methods more robust.},
